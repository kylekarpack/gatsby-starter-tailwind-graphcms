We’re passionate about helping people in any way we can.
--------------------------------------------------------

WSE donates at least 10% of our profits annually and consistently volunteers here in Seattle and around the world. Here are just some of the ways we are happy to have helped people in need.

Corporate Financial Support
===========================

In addition to serving individually and as a group (as described below) WSE is committed to providing financial support to organizations and projects that serve our community. In 2016 WSE donated more than $30,000 to various organizations including Bread of Life Mission, AEE Rwanda, Hope for Children, Antioch Counseling and Treatment Services, Medical Relief International, UW Concrete Canoe Team, Vashon Pony League Baseball, and a number of other projects. In 2015 WSE donated more than $20,000 to Bread of Life Mission, Camp Berachah, Antioch Adoption Services, King Country Sexual Assault Resource Center, the Bel Pres Alternative Gift Market, and the short term missions program at Resonate Church. We’re grateful to be able to partner with these organizations as they provide critical services in our local community and abroad. In addition to corporate funding we encourage our staff to contribute to community service organizations and WSE provides matching funds when possible.

Hope for Children and AEE – Kigali, Rwanda
==========================================================

In November 2016 Larry and Marissa Karpack traveled to Kigali, Rwanda and visited the Hope for Children School. They also toured several mission projects of African Evangelistic Enterprise.  WSE has become a sponsor of the Hope for Children School and helped construct a new school building with 3 classrooms.  Our intent is to work with the school over the coming years to help improve early childhood education education in Rwanda.

Habitat for Humanity’s Women Build – Anchorage, Alaska
=================================================================

On May 1st, Shaina Sabatine and Sarah Eberhart travelled to Anchorage, Alaska for a week-long Habitat for Humanity build trip. Shaina and Sarah volunteered their time working on Habitat homes in various stages of construction. This trip was also special because it was part of Habitat for Humanity’s Women Build program which encourages women who want to learn construction skills to help build homes and communities. As part of this program, Shaina and Sarah participated in discussions with local female volunteers and Habitat recipients concerning poverty issues especially as they affect women.

Kayak Patrol Cleanup – Lake Union, Seattle
=============================================================

WSE joined the Puget Soundkeeper Alliance for their weekly Kayak Patrol on Lake Union. In two hours, WSE staff members collected over 60 lbs of garbage along the Lake Washington Ship Canal and Lake Union shoreline. It was a beautiful day for paddling around Lake Union while serving the community by helping to keep our waterways clean.

Sponsorships
============

In addition to our ongoing sponsorship and serving at the Bread of Life Mission, WSE is also an active sponsor of local organizations and activities.  WSE is a proud sponsor of the University of Washington’s regional champion concrete canoe team, and Pony league baseball teams in both Renton and Vashon Island, and Heart of the Sound Triathlon.  Beyond simply monetary contributions to these organizations, we also commit our time through coaching (Bob in Renton and Jeff on Vashon) or personal involvement such as all of our staff at the Bread of Life.

Emergency Feeding Program – Seattle
========================================================

![](http://watershedse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/community.jpg "community")

Watershed Science & Engineering returned to the Emergency Feeding Program of Seattle and King County again this year. On October 16th we helped pack more than 100 bags of food, sorted over 10 tons of canned goods, and restocked the warehouse shelves at the Renton facility. Our entire staff was there as well as several family members. The food we sorted was donated to the program during the recent Mayor’s Food Drive. The Emergency Feeding Program serves food banks, schools, churches, and other organizations by supplying 14 different varieties of non-perishable emergency grocery bags. We encourage you to check out the program at [www.emergencyfeeding.org](http://www.emergencyfeeding.org) and consider how you might support this really great organization.

WSE considers community service to be a key part of our mission. In addition to office wide events like the one mentioned here, we are excited to provide each of our employees with paid leave to work on community service activities that are of interest to them. These include both local and global activities.

Staff Community Service Projects
==============================================

**Erika** recently bicycled over 450 miles from Seattle to Portland via the Olympic Peninsula over 5 days in June to raise funds and awareness for Blood:Water Mission, an organization that helps underdeveloped communities in Africa build clean-water projects, latrines, and health clinics. The funds raised will help Blood:Water Mission continue its work throughout Marsabit, Kenya and other areas in sub-Saharan Africa. You can learn more about Ride Well Tours and the Blood:Water Mission at the Ride Well website, which can be found here: [www.ridewelltour.org](http://www.ridewelltour.org)

**Chris** spent one week this August volunteering with the Cowlitz County chapter of Habitat for Humanity. Under HH’s home build and “A Brush with Kindness” program, Chris worked alongside his parents and other volunteers to provide building, painting, landscaping, weather stripping and minor repair services for homeowners in need. “A Brush with Kindness” seeks to help low-income homeowners impacted by age, disability and family circumstances, who struggle to maintain the exterior of their homes, reclaim their homes with pride and dignity.

Bread of Life Mission – Seattle
========================================================

![](http://watershedse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/service1.png "Service")
Watershed Science & Engineering performed another group Community Service activity on April 19th & 20th. We worked at the Bread of Life Mission right here in Pioneer Square. First, our staff toured the mission building, and learned more about the Bread of Life and their many life-changing services. We then split up into two teams, one serving lunch on the 19th and the other serving lunch on the 20th. In total, we helped serve lunch to over 300 people. The Bread of Life Mission has been feeding Seattle’s hungry & vulnerable for 73 years. In addition to the meals they serve daily, the Mission operates a day & night shelter, men & women’s recovery programs, and a local box lunch catering business for the Seattle Business District. Learn more about these programs and ways you can be involved through their website: [www.breadoflifemission.org](http://www.breadoflifemission.org). We continue to help serve lunch at the Bread of Life Mission twice each month, and look forward to remaining involved with them well into the future.
