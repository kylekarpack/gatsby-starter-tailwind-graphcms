_Avista Utilities Corp. sought a new FERC license to continue operation at its five hydroelectric facilities along the Spokane River. The relicensing was conducted under the collaborative, Alternative Licensing Procedure (ALP) which aims to elicit stakeholder input throughout the process rather than simply at the end of the effort. Because the ALP involves stakeholders throughout the licensing process, it can simplify FERC approval of the final license conditions; however, it requires substantially greater interaction and flexibility on the part of the relicensing team._  
  
**Role / Services:** While an NHC employee, Larry was project manager and principal hydrologist for the instream flow and beneficial use studies requested by the project stakeholders. He also worked with Avista and key stakeholders to ensure that all questions regarding the project hydrology were evaluated and answered in a forthright manner. His efforts helped to build trust among the stakeholders ultimately resulting in acceptance of the license conditions.  
  
**Outcome:** Avista received a new FERC License for the Spokane River Project in June 2009.
