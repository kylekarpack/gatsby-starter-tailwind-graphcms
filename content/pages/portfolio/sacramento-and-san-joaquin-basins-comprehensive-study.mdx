_Competition for limited water resources in the State of California has forced the State and Federal governments to re-evaluate reservoir storage to determine if reallocation can improve both flood control and water supply._  
  
**Role / Services:** Larry, while an NHC principal hydrologist, was responsible for a re-evaluation of flood control storage at six reservoir sites to determine if additional flood control could be provided to downstream communities without endangering critical water supplies. Dam modifications to increase storage and new off-channel storage projects were also evaluated to determine the potential benefits of these projects.  
  
**Outcome:** The study evaluated 252 alternatives and provided the data necessary to identify several projects for more detailed analyses.
