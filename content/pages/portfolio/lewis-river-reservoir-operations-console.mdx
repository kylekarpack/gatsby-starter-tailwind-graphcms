_Following disastrous flooding on the Lewis River in February 1996, PacifiCorp sought to implement a high runoff operations plan that would optimize reservoir releases and minimize downstream flooding. Short term flow forecasts for the Lewis are available from the National Weather Service and private parties. PacifiCorp wanted to use these forecast to update its high runoff procedures and to develop a decision support system (operations console) to guide operations at their three reservoirs on the river._  
  
**Role / Services:** As an NHC employee, Larry worked with PacifiCorp to refine the Lewis River reservoir operations plan and then directed NHC computer programmers in the development of a decision support system (DSS) that would retrieve real-time data and flow forecasts and determine the required releases from the Lewis River Projects. The DSS allows differing levels of control to hydro system operators and managers to manually QA/QC data, verify the required releases under various alternative forecasts, and evaluate a range of what-if scenarios in real time. Larry also assisted PacifiCorp in getting Corps of Engineers and FERC approval for the new runoff procedures.  
  
**Outcome:** The operations console has been installed and is providing continuous reservoir operation guidance to hydro operators. The console simplifies evaluation of complex reservoir operating policies and also allows real time evaluation of forecasts from different providers and alternative operating decisions. Implementation of the console is expected to simplify operations and, together with the forecast data, reduce flooding downstream of the PacifiCorp reservoirs.
