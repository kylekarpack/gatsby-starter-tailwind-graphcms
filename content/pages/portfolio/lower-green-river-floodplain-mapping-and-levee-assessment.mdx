_King County and Green River valley Cities needed to evaluate flood hazard risk and produce updated flood maps for the lower Green River valley, between SR 18 and the river's mouth. The County also needed to conduct a risk based assessment of the Green River levees to help set priorities for future levee repairs and improvements._  
  
**Role / Services:** While an employee of NHC, Larry managed the consultant team responsible for this project. His work included oversight of NHC staff engineers who completed hydrologic analyses, HEC- RAS and HEC-GeoRAS hydraulic modeling under steady state and unsteady conditions, FLO-2D hydraulic modeling, GIS based inundation mapping, FEMA submittals, levee breach modeling and analysis, and a risk based levee assessment. Larry also coordinated geotechnical, survey, and aerial mapping sub-consultants and supported King County through the FEMA review process and in public meetings.  
  
**Outcome:** The floodplain study was reviewed and approved by FEMA and will be incorporated into the forthcoming release of the King County Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM). The study provides the Cities and County with a current, highly detailed evaluation of flood risk, allowing more informed floodplain management decisions. The levee assessment also allows the County to prioritize necessary repairs and improvements to the levees to safeguard the billions of dollars of commercial property in the Kent Valley.
