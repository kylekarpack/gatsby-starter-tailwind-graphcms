_Existing flood hazard mapping around Vashon and Maury Islands in King County is only approximate and does not provide any indication of potential flood water levels or velocity hazards. King County wanted to update these coastal flood hazard maps to better quantify flood risk and safeguard property owners and infrastructure._  
  
**Role / Services:** While an NHC employee, Larry led the consultant project team that included NHC staff and sub-consultant bathymetric surveyors, aerial photogrammetrists, and coastal hydraulic engineers. He oversaw the development of an approach to implement FEMA's new Pacific Coast Flood Hazard Mapping Guidelines to map 100-year wave runup, overtopping water levels, and high velocity hazard zones for the entire coastline of the islands. King County's project manager for this study has requested Larry's continued support in public meetings to present the new study data.  
  
**Outcome:** The study provides the County with a quantitative assessment of coastal flood hazards on the island. This information, together with forthcoming coastal development regulations, will allow residents to understand and take action to minimize risk related to coastal flood hazards.
