title: Ten Mile Creek Bridge Replacement Hydraulic Analysis

---

_WSE, retained by Sargent Engineers, provided hydraulic design services for the replacement of an aging bridge over Ten Mile Creek in Whatcom County, WA._  
  
**Role / Services:** WSE visited the site and documented existing bridge conditions. A hydraulic model was developed to assess hydraulic conditions at the existing crossing and to evaluate proposed replacement alternatives.  
  
**Outcome:** Based on the hydraulic evaluation, WSE and Sargent determined a bridge span that would safely pass the 100-year design event with adequate freeboard. A bridge protection concept was also developed to protect exposed abutment slopes under the bridge. Construction is anticipated in the summer of 2017.
