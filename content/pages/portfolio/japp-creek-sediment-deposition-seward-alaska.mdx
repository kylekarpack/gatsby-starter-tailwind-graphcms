_In response to a devastating flood in October 2006, FEMA Region X asked Jeff to travel to Seward, Alaska to examine erosion and sedimentation problems and to assess their impact on flood risk. At one key site nearly 200,000 cubic yards of material deposited during the flood and raised the bed of Japp Creek an average of four feet. This reduced the riverward height of a major flood control levee down to 8 feet from 12 feet, significantly reducing the flood carrying capacity of the stream and increasing flood and avulsion risk._  
  
**Role/Services:** As an NHC employee, Jeff traveled to Seward, examined hydraulic and geomorphic conditions of many local streams, met with local officials, prepared a list of recommended actions, and reported back to FEMA. This then led to an investigation of sediment trends within Japp Creek and several neighboring streams. Both Jeff and Larry worked with a team of NHC staff engineers to complete the investigations.  
  
**Outcome:** Jeff and Larry returned to Seward to meet with City of Seward officials and the borough's local flood advisory board to discuss the study results. The City and flood board are using this information to develop long-term flood and sediment management priorities for the community.
