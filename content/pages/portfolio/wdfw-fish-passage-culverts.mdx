_The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife developed guidelines to help hydraulic engineers and geomorphologists design bridge crossings that will preserve aquatic habitat or minimize impact. Early draft versions of the document were not well received by agencies responsible for bridge repair and construction._  
  
**Role:** Having worked for many public works officials and also with the WDFW staff member responsible for preparing the guidelines, Jeff volunteered to edit the document and provide input to help address the concerns raised by public works officials.  
  
**Services:** Editing, technical input, and technical committee participation.  
  
**Outcome:** The improved the document is now a chapter in the 2013 Water Crossings Design Guidelines published by WDFW.
