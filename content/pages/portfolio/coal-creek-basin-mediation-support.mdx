_The City of Bellevue needed to address flooding and sedimentation issues in the Coal Creek watershed, primarily with regard to the delta at the mouth of the creek at Lake Washington. An earlier basin planning study had identified a range of projects necessary to mitigate for historic logging and mining activities and to reduce problems associated with increased urbanization in the basin. The City and King County were sued by a delta landowner who claimed that delays in implementation of upstream projects was the primary cause of continued flooding on his property._  
  
**Role/Services:** As an NHC employee, Larry was project manager and lead hydrologist for this project. He prepared hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, oversaw field data collection activities, provided QA/QC for geomorphic and sedimentation analyses, and represented both the City of Bellevue and King County at the mediation hearings that resulted in a settlement to the lawsuit.  
  
**Outcome:** The work done by Larry, and in particular the trust that all parties involved in the mediation placed in him, enabled the parties to reach agreement on the key issues in the lawsuit without costly delays or trial.
