_Whatcom County is developing a design to replace a structurally deficient bridge that carries Potter Road over the South Fork of the Nooksack River._  
  
**Role / Services:** Work performed by Jeff and Bob, while employees at NHC, included developing detailed one- and two-dimensional hydraulic models to evaluate alternative bridge designs and roadway alignments, and completion of a geomorphic reach evaluation to help determine an acceptable bridge span length and waterway configuration that would minimize impacts to aquatic habitat and flooding. We also provided technical support to the County during discussions with WDFW.  
  
**Outcome:** The assessment revealed that numerous existing private revetments and a training dike limit the river's future ability to move laterally. This information was key to determining a reasonable bridge length that would accommodate likely future channel adjustments, would minimize flood and habitat impacts, and was acceptable to WDFW.
