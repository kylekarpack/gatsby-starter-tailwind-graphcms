_King County's Department of Natural Resources and Parks, Water and Land Resources Division, River and Floodplain Management Section is concerned that severe bank erosion along the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River could damage an existing levee, and threaten adjacent homes and infrastructure._  
  
**Role / Services:** While at NHC Jeff, Larry, and Chris completed a detailed geomorphic and hydraulic investigation to determine the cause of the erosion, likely future evolution of the bank, and the potential for the river to leave its existing channel and follow a new course through developed areas of North Bend. Work included hydrologic data development, RiverFLO-2D hydraulic modeling, evaluation of bank migration and avulsion potential, identification of alternatives, mitigation recommendations, and presentation of findings to a King County Council member and the public. While at WSE, Jeff and Larry continued to monitor conditions during the 2011 winter to determine if bank erosion progressed as predicted. Observations were documented and included in the final project report.  
  
**Outcome:** Jeff and Larry concluded that bank erosion remains a concern but the greatest risk is no longer at the levee; instead, the primary threat has moved upstream. Recommendations included actively monitoring conditions and being prepared to place large riprap should erosion begin to threaten the integrity of the levee or the safety of a neighboring home. It was also concluded that an avulsion of the channel across the floodplain is highly unlikely.
