_Following the failure of several East coast bridges and deaths, a national program was initiated to evaluate all public bridge crossings for vulnerability to scour and erosion._  
  
**Role / Services:** While at NHC, Jeff was responsible for managing more that 400 bridge scour evaluations and personally performing scour evaluations on over 200 bridges for the Washington State and Oregon State Departments of Transportation. He also evaluated scour potential at approximately 50 bridges in six national parks, including Yellowstone National Park, and monuments in Utah for the Federal Highway Administration. Also while at NHC, Bob was responsible for evaluating scour potential and channel degradation at about 75 bridges in Oregon and California. All evaluations utilized procedures recommended in the FHWA HEC-18 manual "Evaluating Scour at Bridges" and other state-of-the-art procedures, and were successful as a result of our personal expertise in bridge scour analysis.  
  
**Outcome:** WSDOT, ODOT, FHWA and Caltrans identified vulnerable bridges, developed monitoring plans and installed countermeasures at sites that were found to have significant scour problems.
