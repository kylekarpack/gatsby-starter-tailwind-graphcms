_Recent FEMA flood insurance maps were developed for the Puyallup River, based upon updated hydraulic modeling using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers? HEC-RAS program. Due to recent decertification of the earthen flood control levees that confine the lower Puyallup, resulting flood maps from the updated Flood Insurance Study showed significant flooding through critical infrastructure and commercial development, including the City of Fife, Interstate 5, and the Port of Tacoma. An investigation was conducted to evaluate river capacity and levee freeboard under present and future conditions assuming sediment deposition, with the aim of developing a ?certified? flood protection system that removes these critical developed lands from the 100-year floodplain._  
  
**Role / Services:** While at NHC, Jeff Johnson managed the FEMA flood insurance mapping study for Pierce County, which included the Puyallup River along with 16 other streams. HEC-RAS models were developed for each stream, resulting in 100-year water surface profiles and inundation mapping used to update the flood insurance study for Pierce County. Bob Elliot provided technical input and review, as well as final QA/QC for the models developed under this project. Jeff was also the project manager for the subsequent flood reduction study on the lower Puyallup River, which used the HEC-RAS model developed for the FEMA study along with sediment transport analysis to evaluate in detail the existing conditions of the levees and their freeboard deficiencies.  
  
**Outcome:** Updated FEMA profiles and maps have been developed for the streams in Pierce County, including the Puyallup River. Phase 1 of the lower Puyallup Flood Reduction Study has also been completed, which consisted of the Existing Conditions Investigation to provide background data needed to assess the magnitude of the problem and to justify pursuit of a new or upgraded flood control system.
