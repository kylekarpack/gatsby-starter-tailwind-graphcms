_Mason County was having difficulty obtaining an HPA permit to replace a bridge that was destroyed by a flood on December 3, 2007. WDFW was concerned that the hydraulic and geomorphic analysis that had been submitted with the HPA application was inadequate to confirm that the proposed bridge would not harm fish habitat._  
  
**Role / Services:** Work performed by Jeff and Larry, while employees at NHC, included review of basin hydrology and river hydraulics, a detailed assessment of geomorphic reach processes, design recommendations to minimize habitat impacts, and support for County discussions with WDFW.  
  
**Outcome:** Investigation revealed that with only minor refinements, the proposed bridge would not adversely impact channel morphology and, therefore, habitat. WDFW reviewed the technical report, accepted the analysis, and approved the HPA permit. A new bridge was built in 2009.
