_Eugene Sand & Gravel was seeking approval from the State of Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI) to increase the depth of their mine. DOGAMI considered the request and asked Eugene S&G to retain a specialist to examine conditions along the river bank to assess the potential for the McKenzie River to erode through the bank and enter or "capture" the mine._  
  
**Role/Services:** While an employee at NHC, Jeff led an investigation to examine the condition of existing river bank and to determine if an avulsion into the pit was likely. Jeff was the lead investigator and participated in a detailed field inspection of the reach, a geomorphic reach assessment, an evaluation of sediment deposition trends, and an assessment of river avulsion and pit capture potential.  
  
**Outcome:** It was shown that a pit capture by lateral migration is possible and that adequate protection will need to be maintained along the river bank to prevent migration of the channel. Jeff recommended that Eugene S&G upgrade existing armor at two locations along the river bank and begin a long term annual plan to monitor conditions along the bank and within the river.
