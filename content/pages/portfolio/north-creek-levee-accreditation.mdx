_Chris Frei and Jeff Johnson provided hydraulic modeling and mapping support for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) within the North Creek Business Park in Bothell, WA. The existing North Creek levees were no longer recognized by FEMA as providing 100-year flood protection, and forthcoming flood maps would therefore show the Business Park within the 1 percent annual chance flood inundation limits._  
  
**Role / Services:** The existing FEMA HEC-RAS hydraulic model was updated based on stream-channel survey and calibrated to the flood of record experienced on December 3, 2007. The calibrated model was used to simulate the 1 percent annual chance flood and determine existing levee freeboard. Model geometry was then updated to test a number of alternative measures to bring the levees into compliance - including vegetation management, bridge removal, channel widening, and levee enhancement. Chris and Jeff coordinated a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) to obtain FEMA approval for mapping changes from planned levee enhancements, and coordinated the LOMR submittal, following CLOMR approval and completion of levee re-construction.  
  
**Outcome:** Updated FEMA maps will show the accredited levee system as providing 100-year flood protection to the North Creek Business Park. WSE continues to monitor flow and water surface elevations along North Creek to help steer future channel maintenance strategies.
