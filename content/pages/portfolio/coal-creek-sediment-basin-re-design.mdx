_It was shown that a pit capture by lateral migration is possible and that adequate protection will need to be maintained along the river bank to prevent migration of the channel. Jeff recommended that Eugene S&G upgrade existing armor at two locations along the river bank and begin a long term annual plan to monitor conditions along the bank and within the river._  
  
**Role/Services:** While an employee at NHC, Jeff met with County and WDFW officials to assess concerns and recommend an approach to produce the scientific data needed to help the stakeholders identify an acceptable solution. Jeff conducted field inspections, evaluated historic sediment deposition rates within the basin, provided guidance and review of HEC-RAS modeling completed by an NHC staff engineer, and discussed alternative sediment basin configurations with the County, WDFW, and other key stakeholders.  
  
**Outcome:** A practical, cost effective design was developed that was acceptable to all stakeholders. It was constructed by County maintenance crews in the fall of 2009. The sediment basin was cleaned in October 2010. The bridge waterway is open and flooding problems have been reduced.
