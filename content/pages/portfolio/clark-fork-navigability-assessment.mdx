_The State of Montana sought to collect fees from Avista as compensation for Avista's historic storage of water on land claimed by the State as a result of the State's belief that the waters were navigable at the time of statehood. Avista needed to demonstrate that the Clark Fork was not navigable at statehood and, therefore, the State did not have a right to recover fees for the storage of water at Noxon Rapids and Cabinet Gorge reservoirs._  
  
**Role / Services:** As an NHC employee, Larry reviewed historic data regarding navigation on the river, conducted hydraulic analyses to evaluate river flow depths and velocities prior to the construction of the dams, and presented his findings in a report that was used by Avista's legal team in their response to the State of Montana.  
  
**Outcome:** While the hydrologic and hydraulic data showed that the reach of the Clark Fork River near the two dam sites was not amenable to navigation at the time of statehood, the legal questions surrounding navigability are still being litigated.
