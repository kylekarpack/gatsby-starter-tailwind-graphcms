_Having shifted west, the Middle Fork of the Nooksack River raised concern within Whatcom County over the security of the west main span pier._  
  
**Role / Services:** Work performed by Jeff, while an employee of NHC, involved estimating scour and erosion potential at a key pier that is supported on a shallow spread footing. The pier was surrounded by an existing rock revetment that was in poor condition. Jeff recommended upgrades to the revetment.  
  
**Outcome:** The protection was upgraded in 2009.
