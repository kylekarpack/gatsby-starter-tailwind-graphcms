_The Quadrant Corporation was seeking to develop an 1100 acre Master Planned Development on the Redmond Plateau. The project site included many large wetlands and various other sensitive areas that needed the highest level of protection possible. Sophisticated hydrologic modeling and analysis of the project area and downstream corridor were conducted to evaluate current environmental conditions and design stormwater management facilities to eliminate or mitigate all potential impacts._  
  
**Role / Services:** Over a 10 year period as an NHC employee, Larry was responsible for stormwater planning, evaluation, and design from the conceptual stage through implementation of the development. The project was one of the first MPD's ever permitted in King County and the work done by Larry helped King County define appropriate standards for stormwater control, wetland protection, infiltration facility design, and downstream erosion protection.  
  
**Outcome:** The scale of this development was larger than any previous Master Planned Development undertaken in King County and the environmental issues surrounding the project were significant. The innovative work conducted by Larry and the uncompromising standard of care on the work allowed the project to stand up to the highest level of public scrutiny and ultimately helped achieve an environmentally responsible and award winning development.
