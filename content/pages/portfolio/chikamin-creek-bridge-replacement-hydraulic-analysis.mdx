_WSE provided hydraulic design services for the replacement of an aging forest service bridge over Chikamin Creek in Chelan County, WA._  
  
**Role / Services:** Following a site visit to document reach conditions, WSE estimated design flood discharges, completed hydraulic modeling, and examined stream stability and channel morphology.  
  
**Outcome:** Modeling results were used to determine a bridge span necessary to meet agency requirements as well as developing appropriate scour protection recommendations. This project is on-going, with bridge replacement planned for Summer 2013.
