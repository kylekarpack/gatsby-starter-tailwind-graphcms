_As a result of the recent King County remapping of the lower Green River, large areas within the City of Kent were added to the FEMA regulatory floodplain because the levees protecting these area are not certified. The City of Kent is seeking to improve the levees and provide other necessary modifications to obtain certification and thus reduce the regulatory burden of the new floodplain maps._  
  
**Role / Services:** While at NHC, Larry managed all aspects of the hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and mapping as necessary to support four CLOMR requests for levee certification by GeoEngineers and the City. Larry oversaw Flo-2D modeling, interior drainage studies, work map and FIRM production, FEMA CLOMR submittal, and response to reviewer comments for these projects. Larry has continued to consult to the City of Kent on these projects while at WSE.  
  
**Outcome:** CLOMR applications have been submitted for final review by FEMA and Larry is continuing to work with the City in responding to review comments.
