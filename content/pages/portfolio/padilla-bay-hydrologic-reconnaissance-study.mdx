_The Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (PBNERR) wanted to develop a better understanding of hydrologic issues as related to the ecological function of the Padilla Bay Estuary._  
  
**Role / Services:** While with NHC, Larry worked with the PBNERR to design and implement a comprehensive hydrologic gaging program, to develop hydrologic models for key watersheds draining to the estuary, and to evaluate existing and potential tidal interactions at several drainage outfalls.  
  
**Outcome:** The project provided the PBNERR with the framework and tools necessary to begin monitoring current hydrologic conditions in the Padilla Bay watershed and to evaluate the implications of potential future changes.
