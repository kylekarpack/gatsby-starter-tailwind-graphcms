_As part of their periodic dam safety evaluations of the Lewis River Projects, PacifiCorp prepared an updated Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) study in 2006. The implication of the new study was that one or more of the Lewis River dams did not have adequate capacity to pass the inflow design flood. If this result were found to be accurate, the dams would require significant costly improvements to bring them into compliance with FERC regulations._  
  
**Role / Services:** While an employee at NHC, Larry was responsible for a peer review of PacifiCorp's updated PMF study. When that review identified significant conservatism in the study, Larry oversaw the development of a revised PMF. While that study produced a lower and more accurate estimate of the PMF, there were still concerns regarding overtopping of the dams. In response to this, PacifiCorp decided to commission a detailed site specific PMP/PMF study. Larry is leading the consultant project team for that study.  
  
**Outcome:** The work provides the most sophisticated, scientifically defensible estimate of the inflow design flood for the Lewis River projects allowing a reliable evaluation of spillway capacity to ensure the safety of downstream residents. Any resultant reduction in the project inflow design flood will eliminate unnecessary expenditures by PacifiCorp, perhaps saving ratepayers millions of dollars. Larry, as a WSE employee, is continuing to lead the consultant team under subcontract to NHC.
