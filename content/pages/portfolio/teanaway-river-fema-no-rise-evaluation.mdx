_Kittitas County Public Works asked WSE to develop a solution to a floodway development issue on the Middle Fork of the Teanaway River. A home was built within the limits of the regulatory floodway but a "No-Rise" analysis had not been completed._  
  
**Role/Services:** WSE staff examined the site, reviewed existing FEMA floodplain and floodway maps, and completed a technical evaluation to determine if the home and associated land improvements produce a rise in regulatory flood levels.  
  
**Outcome:** WSE found that the improvements produce a slight rise, but that relatively minor modifications to an existing driveway and small earthen berm could eliminate the impact.
