_Spencer Road bridge over Blue Creek in Lewis County is experiencing significant sediment deposition problems. Sediment has nearly filled the bridge waterway, which has increased flooding frequency and severity. Watershed Science & Engineering conducted an investigation to identify the physical processes that are transporting and depositing sediment at the bridge, and to identify and evaluate alternative solutions._  
  
**Role / Services:** WSE conducted a detailed hydrologic, hydraulic, and geomorphic investigation then identified and evaluated five alternative solutions to reduce sediment and flooding problems Spencer Road.  
  
**Outcome:** WSE prepared a technical report to document the results of the investigation and to present the alternative solutions. The County will use the report as a tool to help determine a long term approach to reduce and manage the problem.
