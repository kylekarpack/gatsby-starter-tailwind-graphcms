_WSE was retained to design emergency scour protection for a threatened bridge pier located within Bear Creek in Central Point, Oregon. At the time WSE was alerted to the problem, the creek in-water work window had closed, and the need to install protection before winter flooding resulted in an extremely tight timeline for permit submittal and approval._  
  
**Role / Services:** WSE worked with agencies to develop an acceptable solution that provides effective pier protection while minimizing impacts to the creek.  
  
**Outcome:** By working closely with agency personnel, WSE was able to get the project designed and permitted within a matter of weeks. Protection was successfully installed on October 30, 2012 and continues to protect the bridge pier.
