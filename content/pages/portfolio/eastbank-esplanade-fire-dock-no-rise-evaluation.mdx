_The City of Portland Fire Bureau is seeking permits to update the existing Fire Dock and landward Fire Station along the east bank of the Willamette River in downtown Portland, OR._  
  
**Role:** WSE was retained by Flowing Solutions to complete hydraulic modeling of the proposed project and to advise the city of design refinements necessary to keep the project in compliance with FEMA No-Rise requirements.  
  
**Services:** WSE updated an existing HEC-RAS model of the Willamette River to determine if the preliminary design would cause 100-year flood levels to rise. WSE determined that proposed plans, including two new boathouses and refinements to the landward fire station, met FEMA no-rise requirements without further revision. A detailed study report and certification of No-Rise was provided to Flowing Solutions for submittal to the City of Portland along with other permitting documents.  
  
**Outcome:** The permit application is currently under review by the City.
