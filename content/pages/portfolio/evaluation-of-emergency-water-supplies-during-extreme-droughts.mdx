_The City of Seattle is concerned that additional demands on their water supply system, coupled with the potential for reduced supplies as a result of climate change, may reduce the reliability of the City's water supply to an unacceptable level. The City needed to evaluate the potential for a significant drought and the vulnerability of their system to such an event._  
  
**Role/Services:** As an NHC employee, Larry reviewed scientific literature related to the characterization of extreme droughts and evaluated alternative methods for developing hydrologic data for including use of paleo-indicators. He also conducted hydrologic assessments of current reservoir inflow and refill patterns and extrapolated the available information to assess the likelihood that the City's water supply system would be stressed beyond acceptable limits.  
  
**Outcome:** The study determined that the City's water supply system was relatively robust and that the occurrence of a drought at the level that would create a public emergency was remote.
