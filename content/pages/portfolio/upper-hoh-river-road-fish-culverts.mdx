_WSE was retained to provide hydraulic engineering services for three culvert replacements along the Upper Hoh River Road in Jefferson County, Washington. Each site presented unique engineering challenges including sediment deposition and proximity to the highly dynamic Hoh River._  
  
**Role / Services**: At each crossing, WSE estimated design flood discharges, evaluated sire hydraulics, assessed channel morphology and stability, developed recommendations for crossing dimensions, scour/erosion countermeasures, and sediment management actions.  
  
**Outcome:** WSE provided design recommendations to produce long-lasting, low maintenance crossings that meet hydraulic design and fish passage requirements.
