_Cascade Irrigation District needed to make modifications to increase their ability to draw water at their intake on the Yakima River near Ellensburg. Because the project had the potential to affect threatened salmon species, mitigation was required in the form of modifications to upstream revetments and levees to restore flow into a historic side channel and wetland._  
  
**Role / Services:** While at NHC, Larry managed this project, conducted hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, and coordinated work with the Cascade Irrigation District and WDFW fisheries biologists. NHC staff from Vancouver BC prepared designs and oversaw construction of a new rock drop structure at the Cascade Intake and modifications to the upstream levee to equalize flow splits to the main channel, a side channel, and the off-channel Gladmar wetland.  
  
**Outcome:** Both the rock drop structure at the intake and modifications to the upstream levee were designed, permitted, and installed within 4 months of the project start-up. The Cascade intake is now more reliable and requires significantly less maintenance. Additionally, restoration of flows to the off-channel wetland has been well received by tribal and state fisheries biologists.
