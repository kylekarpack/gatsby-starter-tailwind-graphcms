_Whatcom County retained WSE to determine if a practical and cost effective solution can be found to alleviate chronic sediment deposition problems at the Mosquito Lake Road bridge over Canyon Creek. Sediment has significantly reduced the size of the bridge waterway which in-turn has increased the frequency and severity of flooding problems in the vicinity of the bridge._  
  
**Role / Services:** WSE is currently conducting a geomorphic investigation to identify the physical fluvial processes that are transporting and depositing sediment within the bridge waterway. Project tasks include a general topographic survey, an evaluation of basin hydrology, a detailed assessment of channel and basin geology, geomorphology, sediment transport and deposition, development of a simple HEC-RAS model to evaluate hydraulic conditions, and the identification and evaluation of alternative solutions.  
  
**Outcome:** This project is on-going.
