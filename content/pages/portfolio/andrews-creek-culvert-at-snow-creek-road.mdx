_Jefferson County identified Andrews Creek culvert at MP 3.78 on Snow Creek Road as a barrier to fish passage. Andrews Creek is a pool-riffle stream that is located within the eastern slopes of the Olympic Mountain Range. Jefferson County retained WSE to determine a practical and cost effective solution for replacing the culvert._  
  
**Role / Services:** WSE helped determine the type, size, and location of the new crossing. Project tasks included identifying areas for a general topographic survey, an evaluation of basin hydrology, an assessment of channel and basin geology, channel stability and erosion countermeasure concepts, development of a simple HEC-RAS model to evaluate hydraulic conditions, and the identification and evaluation of alternative solutions. Both a 3-sided concrete box culver and a metal pipe arch were considered for the proposed crossing. WSE also provided a technical memorandum, as part of identification of the necessary permits.  
  
**Outcome:** The culvert was replaced during the summer of 2014.
