title: Seward Alaska Hydrologic Analysis for FEMA Floodplain Mapping

categories: ["Hydrology"]
---

_FEMA retained NHC to provide new detailed floodplain mapping studies for Seward, Alaska and updated hydrologic data were needed. The hydrology of the area is complicated by the fact that many of its streams and rivers originate on glaciers or in very narrow, steep walled valleys and, as such, are subject to exceptionally large but very infrequent glacial outburst or debris dam breach floods._  
  
**Role / Services:** Working as an NHC employee Larry developed a methodology to use historic USGS flow records together with anecdotal and other evidence of debris floods and a recent regression based model developed by the USGS for Alaska to establish reasonable flood flow frequency estimates for all rivers in the study area. Larry researched historical debris flows, flood flow frequency analysis, regression analyses, innovative mixed flood model approach, support for independent technical review by FEMA, USGS, and Corps of Engineers.  
  
**Outcome:** The innovative hydrologic analysis was reviewed and approved by federal agencies and resulted in the most realistic flood flow frequency data for floodplain mapping of the rivers and streams near Seward, Alaska.
