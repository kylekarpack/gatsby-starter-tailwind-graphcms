Fluvial geomorphology is the study of the physical processes that shape and maintain river and stream form. This scientific discipline recognizes that an in-depth understanding of a riverâ€™s history and site specific conditions are critical to successful management and restoration.

Geomorphologists seek to understand the processes by which rivers developed their unique characteristics and to predict future changes through a combination of field observation and technical analysis. Fluvial geomorphologists recognize that a river is intimately connected to adjacent hillslopes, floodplains, riparian corridors, hyporheic and groundwater zones; upstream and downstream portions of the drainage basin; and to other components of the environment, such as atmospheric and biological systems. Geomorphologists come from a variety of academic backgrounds including geography, geology, or engineering; As engineers, we approach the science of geomorphology from an analytical understanding of the complex linkages between hydrology, hydraulics, geology, and sediment transport.

Our engineering foundation provides us with the unique skills necessary to identify and evaluate geomorphic problems and to design and implement practical solutions.
