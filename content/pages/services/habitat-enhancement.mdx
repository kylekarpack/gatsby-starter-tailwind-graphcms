import Portfolio from "../../../src/components/Portfolio";

The listing of several Pacific Northwest salmonid populations as threatened or endangered has elevated habitat protection to a primary requirement of all stream and river related engineering projects. The need to address aquatic habitat protection has led river scientists and engineers to modify conventional techniques and develop alternative methods to engineer solutions to infrastructure and public safety problems.

At WSE we see ourselves serving clients in projects that require advanced technical expertise in hydrology, hydraulics, fluvial geomorphology, sediment transport, and channel stability. Our approach to these projects is to identify the physical processes at the root of the problem and then use this understanding to design habitat enhancing, low maintenance, cost effective solutions that enhance the ongoing and future morphology of the aquatic system.

WSE staff have both led and provided significant technical input to many such projects, including the design of side channel reconnections, fish-passage culverts, bridge waterways, restored channels, bank protection measures using large woody debris and bio-engineering, enhanced sediment management concepts, and similar projects.
