The transport and deposition of sediment is a critical and fundamental element of healthy and productive river ecosystems. Sediment deposition, however, is often a significant maintenance challenge for public works departments, because it can directly or indirectly threaten infrastructure, initiate or increase bank erosion, or raise flood risk by reducing channel capacity. For more than 20 years, there has essentially been a moratorium on removal of sediment from Pacific Northwest streams and rivers in an effort to protect and preserve sensitive aquatic habitat. During this period, the transport and deposition sediment has continued unabated with the result being that the frequency of sediment induced problems has increased.

WSE is committed to helping clients find practical and informed solutions to sediment deposition problems. The key to finding acceptable solutions is to provide stakeholders with sound scientific data to help inform their decision making processes. Our principal and senior staffâ€™s combined 80 plus years of experience in hydrology, hydraulics, fluvial geomorphology, and sediment transport makes us exceptionally well qualified to take a lead role in this scientific effort. We are highly regarded for our ability to work collaboratively with groups of diverse stakeholders, a key trait needed when trying to find an acceptable solution to an issue that often brings out impassioned views.
