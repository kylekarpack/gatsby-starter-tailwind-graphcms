Staying at the forefront of technical innovation is a key element of WSE’s commitment to client service. New and advancing technologies allow us to perform work more efficiently and provide greater understanding. WSE staff are constantly evaluating new approaches to improve and increase the value of our core services. In the past these have included tools and techniques such as GIS mapping and analysis, advanced numerical modeling for hydrology and hydraulics, and low cost streamflow gaging and data development. These innovative services are now common in our projects. Current innovation efforts include drone-based remote imagery to produce topographic and bathymetric data and remotely acquired structure elevation data.

Examples of past and present innovations include: 

*   GIS mapping
*   Advanced numerical modeling
    *   Continuous simulation hydrology
    *   Two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic modeling
*   2D model graphics
*   Remotely acquired building elevations
*   Sediment modeling
*   ADCP flow and bathymetric data collection
*   Drone imagery
    *   Project visualization
    *   Structure from Motion 1D, 2D, and 3D image and topographic visualization (SfM)
    *   Photo-bathymetry
*   Climate change interpretation


WSE continually evaluates new technologies to determine how they can be implemented to improve our work with a focus on delivering better projects to our clients.
