WSE has extensive experience in developing hydraulic models to evaluate habitat restoration alternatives, levee setbacks and other flood relief measures, dam breach flood routing, bank revetment designs, bridge hydraulics and scour, floodplain impacts, channel erosion and geomorphic response, floodway and floodplain mapping studies, and other challenging hydraulic problems.

As an industry leader in the development and application of both simple and sophisticated numerical hydraulic models, our engineers are proficient and experienced in choosing the appropriate modeling tools that will help to gain insight and solve a given problem. Modeling programs regularly used by WSE staff include one-dimensional steady and unsteady programs such as HEC-RAS and FEQ, and two-dimensional programs such as SRH-2D, RiverFlow2D, FST2DH/FESWMS and FLO-2D, as well as HEC-RAS. Model development is enhanced by our in-house expertise using GIS to develop TINs and other model inputs, as well as associated pre- and post-processing programs such as HEC-GeoRAS, RAS Mapper, and SMS.
