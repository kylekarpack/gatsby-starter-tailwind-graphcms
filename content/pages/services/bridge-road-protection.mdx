Protecting bridges and roads from flood damage is a key service offered by WSE. Our staff bring significant experience in bridge hydraulics, scour evaluation, and habitat-friendly erosion countermeasures.

Over the past 25 years, Jeff has become one of the Northwest’s most respected engineers in the hydraulic design and evaluation of road crossings and the protection of roads themselves. Jeff’s interest in bridges began in college when the Washington State Department of Transportation funded his Masters Degree research which examined bridge scour prediction methods in the Pacific Northwest. Since then he has completed over 400 bridge scour evaluations, over 50 bridge hydraulic investigations for new and replacement crossings, over 25 fish passage culvert designs, and numerous designs for scour and erosion countermeasures.

WSE is personally committed to advancing industry standards to develop reasonable, cost-effective designs for crossings and countermeasures that minimize or eliminate impacts to habitat. WSE focuses on providing clients with practical advice based upon sound science, engineering, and personal knowledge which allows clients to make educated and informed decisions.
