Hydrology, the study of the earth’s water, is at the root of all that we do at WSE. Larry, WSE’s senior hydrologist, is a recognized expert in hydrologic modeling and analysis and has provided expert consulting in hydrology to more than 100 clients in the Pacific Northwest over the past 25 years. Understanding complex theory and sophisticated hydrologic models is critical to this work but practical experience gained through hundreds of projects is even more essential.

WSE staff have designed and implemented gaging networks, conducted field monitoring programs, prepared and analyzed hydrologic data of all types, served as beta testers of new hydrologic models, conducted applied research in snowmelt and runoff forecasting, and assisted various clients in developing an understanding of complex hydrologic systems. While hydrologic analyses are sometimes undertaken simply to develop an improved understanding of current conditions, it is more often the case that these analyses are done to serve as input to river restoration, reservoir operations, floodplain management, sedimentation studies or other disciplines in which WSE works. As such, WSE’s broad skill set including hydraulics and water management allow us to focus our efforts in hydrologic analyses to make the most efficient use of our client’s resources.
