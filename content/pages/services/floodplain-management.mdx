WSE staff have been providing floodplain management consulting services to clients for over 30 years. From assessing current flood hazards to evaluating potential flood mitigation alternatives, WSE has worked extensively in floodplains across the Pacific Northwest.

For over 25 years, Jeff worked as a consultant to the Pacific Northwest Region (Region X) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). During this time Jeff produced new floodplain maps for hundreds of miles of streams in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. He conducted emergency post-flood assessments in Alaska, and provided input to FEMA’s on-going national Map Modernization Plan. Over the past eight years Larry has consulted on numerous occasions to King County’s Department of Natural Resources managing the technical teams developing new flood hazard maps for nearly every river in the County. Larry also directed the development of new Coastal Flood Hazard maps for more than 100 miles of Puget Sound shoreline. WSE routinely consults with local agencies and private clients to help them understand and satisfy floodplain development regulations and requirements. This has included several recent projects assisting municipalities to obtain certification of existing flood protection levees. They have also assisted numerous clients in the preparation of CLOMR and LOMR requests.
