Marissa joined WSE in 2015 as an intern while she was completing her Bachelor's degree in Civil & Environmental Engineering with a focus in hydrology and hydrodynamics at the University of Washington. Marissa re-joined the WSE team after completing her Master's in Civil Engineering with a focus in hydraulic engineering and river mechanics at Colorado State University. Her thesis research developed a method to assess human-caused floodplain degradation at large spatial scales using publicly available datasets. Through graduate school and her time at WSE, Marissa has enjoyed learning how to effectively communicate technical findings to clients and stakeholders.

Marissa works for WSE from Fort Collins, Colorado. Outside of work, she enjoys backpacking, cooking, traveling, and forcing her hiking companions to listen to &#x201C;fun facts&#x201D; about rivers.
