Sarah first joined WSE in October 2014 after completing a Master’s degree in Civil & Environmental Engineering at Colorado State University. While at CSU, Sarah worked as a research assistant with the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) to develop flow-ecology relationships for coastal watersheds of southern California. The aim of this project was to inform watershed planning and management decisions across a gradient of urban settings. Sarah re-joined WSE in 2019 after moving to Fort Collins, CO. Sarah’s work at WSE has included using hydrologic and hydraulic models including HEC-RAS, HSPF, and SWMM to perform “no-rise” analyses and investigate effects of different land-use scenarios and drainage system alternatives on urban flooding problems.

Sarah grew up in Kansas and obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering with an environmental concentration from the University of Kansas. As such, she is an avid Jayhawk basketball fan who also enjoys cooking, playing softball, hiking, and skiing in her free time. In 2012 Sarah traveled to Azacilo, Bolivia with Engineers Without Borders-KU to help with implementation of sanitation improvements and assess water supply in a remote village in the Andes mountains.
