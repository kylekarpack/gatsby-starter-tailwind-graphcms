Kaleb joined WSE in the Fall of 2017 and is in the process of completing a Master's in civil engineering at Washington State University. His graduate work focused on modeling sediment transport in high gradient streams. Alongside his primary research, he participated in a variety of projects that provided experience in field work, sensor deployment, and spatial analysis techniques.

Since joining WSE, Kaleb has gained experience developing 1D and 2D HEC-RAS models, completing hydraulic designs for culvert and bridge crossing structures, developing flood hazard maps, and applying spatial analysis methods to complex hydraulic, hydrologic, and geomorphic problems. Kaleb spends his free time exploring the mountains and faraway places.
