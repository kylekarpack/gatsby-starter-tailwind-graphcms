Chris has practical experience applying a variety of H&H models to support hydraulic analyses and design, and has spent hundreds of hours observing and documenting stream and floodplain conditions, collecting topographic and bathymetric surveys, and implementing stream monitoring programs for urban runoff and natural stream systems.
