Colin joined WSE as a hydraulic engineer in September 2016 after completing his Bachelor's degree in Civil & Environmental Engineering with a focus in hydrology and hydrodynamics at the University of Washington. His background includes maintaining instrument networks and collaborating on projects for mountain and snow hydrology research, and his professional interests include river engineering and water resources management. Since joining WSE, Colin has become familiar with 1D and 2D hydraulic modeling and mapping and application of these tools to flood hazard analysis, impact assessment, habitat restoration, and storm-water conveyance projects. He is also an FAA certified remote pilot, which enables him to safely operate a drone for collecting aerial and topographic data in the field.

In his free time, Colin enjoys biking, mountaineering, backpacking and skiing. When he's not outside or in the mountains, you're likely to find Colin at a local music venue or trying out new cuisines in town.
