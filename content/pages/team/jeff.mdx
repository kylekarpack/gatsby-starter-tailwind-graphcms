Jeff, co-founder of WSE, is an expert in the fields of hydraulics, sediment transport, and geomorphology, especially as they relate to public safety and natural resource protection.

The practice of hydrotechnical science and engineering is complex and ever evolving. For 24 years, Jeff has had the privilege to practice in nature's natural class room as he has helped clients develop practical, cost effective, environmentally sound solutions to difficult and often complex river and stream issues. He routinely helps clients solve difficult problems that threaten public and private infrastructure. He is highly regarded for his expertise in the hydraulic design of environmentally sound bridge crossings, bank protection countermeasures, and stream restoration features. He is respected for his knowledge of floodplain management issues and regulations, and routinely consults on flood relief design. Recently Jeff worked closely with WDFW to provide significant input to their new Bridge Design and Habitat Protection Guidelines.

Jeff loves to coach, having managed over 30 different youth baseball and basketball teams in the past 17 years. When he is not working or coaching Jeff is involved in church activities or spending time with his family fishing and relaxing in the San Juan Islands.
