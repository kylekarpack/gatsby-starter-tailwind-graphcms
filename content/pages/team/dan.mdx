Dan joined WSE in 2018 after completing his PhD at Colorado State University. There, he studied how geomorphic processes regulate wood and sediment storage around rivers. In addition to working for WSE as a fluvial geomorphologist, Dan researches river processes at the University of Washington. His research focuses on how wood and sediment dynamics shape streams and uses a combination of field data collection, remote sensing, and statistical analyses. With these tools and his knowledge of fluvial processes, he helps to develop the context and understanding that are key to solving complex river management challenges. To bridge the gap between academic research and river restoration practice, Dan applies novel research methods to address clients' needs and works to improve the science of sustainable river management.

Dan currently lives in Lafayette, Colorado, but developed his love for rivers and wild landscapes growing up in the Cascade mountains of Washington. As an avid outdoor recreationalist, he spends his free time exploring desert canyons, high mountains, and wild rivers.
