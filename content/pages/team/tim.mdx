Tim joined WSE in 2016. He is in the process of completing a Master's degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks with a focus on sediment transport and river mechanics. With a background in both engineering and geology, Tim is interested in river hydraulics and fluvial geomorphology. Tim's thesis at UAF investigated sediment transport rates and channel response to gravel mining on the Sagavanirktok River in Northern Alaska. He was responsible for collection of sediment samples, ADCP discharge measurements, and repeat bathymetric surveys to support his research. Tim was also involved with several other projects while at UAF, including modeling nearshore wave energy potential for the coastal community of Yakutat, Alaska, and creating a series of maps to communicate flood risk for coastal communities in Western Alaska. For all of these projects, Tim has utilized his knowledge of programming and GIS to manage datasets and create high quality figures.

Since joining WSE, Tim has gained experience developing and analyzing results from several models, including WWHM hydrologic model, HEC-RAS hydraulic 1D and 2D models, and HEC-RAS sediment transport model. Prior to pursuing an engineering degree, Tim completed an MS in Geology at the University of Wyoming and worked as a licensed geologist in the oil, gas, and mining industries.
